Calculator with Hexadecimal Numpad
==================================

[HP-16C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-16C) for hackers, who don't mind wasting CPU cycles and RAM for comfort.

Parts
-----

* [NeoKey 5x6 Ortho Snap-Apart Mechanical Key Switches](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5157) - Finally a PCB with enough (but not too many) buttons!
* [Black Adafruit Feather RP2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4884) - Less powerful boards will probably do the basic functionality but I wanted to make sure my OLED is nice
* [Adafruit 128x64 OLED FeatherWing](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-128x64-oled-featherwing)
* 20x MX compatible keyswitches and caps
* Screws: M2.5 for the FeatherWing, M3 for the keypad

Inspired by
-----------

* [Adafruit Macropad RP2040](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-macropad-rp2040) - It took me a long time to realize, that these kinds of things are called "macropads" - a keyword that made googling for parts much easier!
* [Numpad 4000](https://learn.adafruit.com/numpad-4000-mechanical-keyswitch-data-entry-device/overview) - A great project, but decimal is [BORING](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-hpusjxfw)!

Planned developments
--------------------

* A proper box
* Encoder to assign new functionality to buttons
